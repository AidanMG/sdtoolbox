# We want to obtain the ignition delay lengths by the following method:
# 1. For a given set of initial conditions (P1, T1), compute the ignition delay time using a constant-pressure
#    reactor simulation.
# 2. Given the velocity profile [L/t] = f(L), convert the ignition delay time [t] into an ignition delay length [L].
